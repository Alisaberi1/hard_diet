# hard_diet
Leete, who had long ago lost her heart to Fite, has just realized that she doesn't care for him as much as she remembers. Therefore, Lite has decided to fit her weight and body to the ideal as soon as possible.

After many consultations, he came to the conclusion that no one should eat foods with dangerous health labels. The health guide label is such that it gives information about sugar, salt, and trans fatty acids. And we know that a label is dangerous if it is one of the following conditions:

    At least three are red.
    At least two are red and at least two are yellow.
    All are yellow or red. (It means to be green!)



Lite, who has been a technology junkie since childhood, wants to write a program for a smart watch that will alert him when these foods are eaten. But because these days they are busy thinking, they don't think much and they ask you to help you in writing this program.
#input
The input consists of only one line where the tag is a string of five characters. R stands for red, Y stands for yellow, and G stands for green.
#output
If the tag is a dangerous tag, print nakhor lite on the only output line, otherwise print rahat baash.
